# Getting started with high-performance computing

Before starting the exercises, create a personal working directory and clone the git repository there

    mkdir -p /scratch/project_462000956/$USER
    cd /scratch/project_462000956/$USER
    git clone https://github.com/csc-training/summerschool.git /scratch/project_462000956/$USER/summerschool

Once you have done this, the files remain on LUMI and in the subsequent terminal sessions you can go
directly to your summershool clone:

    cd /scratch/project_462000956/$USER/summerschool

See the [exercise instructions](../exercise-instructions.md) for general instructions.
